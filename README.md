# open-pl-ref-lights
Powerlifting lights and timer system, Python based.  Output is a monitor/TV, input is from USB devices such as gamepads or numpad keyboards.  Intended to run on a RaspberryPi

## current issues
* do we need to show something other than a blank screen when the decision is incomplete?
* maybe make button handling / decision logic more concise?  can it be?
* add proper debug logging instead of prints
* test as much as possible
