# open-pl-ref-lights
Powerlifting lights and timer system, Python based.  Output is a monitor/TV, input is from USB devices such as gamepads or numpad keyboards.  Intended to run on a RaspberryPi

## current issues
* make button handling / decision logic more concise, which will probably fix other issues
* figure out why timer autostarts after clearing lights, and doesn't reset
* figure out why next attempt timer never shows
* test more scenarios
